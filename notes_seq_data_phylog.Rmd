## Working with sequences

? how to do the alignement in R! 

## starting from aligned sequences

phyDat <- an alignement 
- phangorn:read.phyDat : read in an alignment (?read.dna)

DNAbin <- an alignement  
## building trees

1) Distance based methods 
ape:dist.dna <- alignement = class DNAbin , choice substitution model

- rooted: UPGMA
- unrooted: NJ
